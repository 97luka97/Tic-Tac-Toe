# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe with 2 options ( Player vs Player, Player vs Computer)
When you start the application you have two options. One player or two players. In option One player, you are the player X and computer is player O. At the top there are two labels numbering victory. When you play a move, the computer goes through the code and through a series of arrays and after one second tries to play the best move. At the end of the party, depending on who wins and whether any, AlertView pops up that says the final outcome of the game and the Play Again button appears below. At the bottom of the screen is the Main Menu button and pressing it returns to the main menu where you can select another option for playing, then you can also reset the label numbering result. If you choose option two players, everything looks the same, but the difference is that the O player is operated by a another person and not a computer.
